## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Mostly learn to custom design input fields with plain css rather than using `tailwind` like css library.

### Continued development

Oh gosh! When I first decided to take on this project, it seemed pretty simple in my mind. However, as I started working on it, it turned into a much more challenging experience than I anticipated. Designing input fields and customizing the `input:radio` and `input:checkbox` elements proved to be particularly difficult for me. Unfortunately, I struggled to follow the exact CSS styling, as it felt overly complicated. On the other hand, the JavaScript part seemed relatively easier for me, though I still need to make some improvements in terms of optimization and reducing repetitive code.
